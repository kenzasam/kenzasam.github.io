About Graphic Biotech

Innovation, design, biotech and policy. When I met more people

Biotechnology is no longer a mysterious blabla. It is all around us, but also, it isn't questioned it enough. Governments and legislation is lagging behind. Is policy too slow to catch up? And how can we still keep on encouraging crazy multidisciplinary and disruptive biotech innovation  without pinning research down? Can Community Labs play a role in this?
