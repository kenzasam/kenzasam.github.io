About Graphic Biotech

Innovation, design, biotech and policy.
Biotechnology is no longer a mysterious blabla. With techniques being standardised, DIYbio labs popping up and iGEM competitions all over the globe, society is getting more and more involved in this exciting field. But also, as rapid as this field evolves, regulations and legislation are lagging behind. The potential pf biotech isn't understood enough by society. Is policy too slow to catch up? And how can we still keep on encouraging crazy multidisciplinary and disruptive biotech innovation without having limiting frameworks? What role do artists and DIY biologists play in this?
And who are the innovators and entrepreneurs challenging the status quo?
