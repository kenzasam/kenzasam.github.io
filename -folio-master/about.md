About Graphic Biotech

Innovation, design, biotech and policy. When I met more people

Biotechnology is no longer a mysterious blabla. It is all around us, but also, it's potential isn't understood enough by society. Governments and legislation are lagging behind. Is policy too slow to catch up? And how can we still keep on encouraging crazy multidisciplinary and disruptive biotech innovation without having limiting frameworks? What role do artists and DIY biologists play in this?
And who are the innovators and entrepreneurs challenging the status quo?
